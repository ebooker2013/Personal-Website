            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
           <div class="half-width">
             <p>I've made my home base in Denver, CO with my small and growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in marketing.
              After years of working as an analyst, I decided it was time for me to pursue a career that not just inspired me, but fed my desire to
              create. After trying some coding courses online, I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.
            </p>
           </div>
           <div class="half-width">
             <p>
               That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something
               that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. As i continue to learn, I have realized my desires to continue down
               this path and utilize my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.

             <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
               <p> My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate,
                 trouble-shoot and accessible.

             <h3> Well-Organized CSS </h3>
               <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it
               a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.
